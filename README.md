# FIFA_21_Data_Cleaning
This project involves the cleaning of FIFA 21 dataset gotten from Kaggle. The dataset can be gotten from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yagunnersya/fifa-21-messy-raw-dataset-for-cleaning-exploring/versions/1/code

### Project Description:

This project involves cleaning a FIFA 21 dataset gotten from Kaggle. The dataset contains data about players information and statistics according to the FIFA 21 game. The information contained in this dataset includes but is not limited to Player name, Nationality, Team name and contract, Attacking attributes, defending attributes, Position, Height, Weight, etc.

My thought process and complete step by step process of cleaning this data can be found [on my medium page](https://medium.com/@f.jtundeadedipe/data-cleaning-fifa-21-dataset-a1a1b202810b)

### The project involved the following steps:

1) The first step was to create a duplicate of the raw data.
2) Data Exploration: The first step was to explore the data and identify any potential problems such as missing values, duplicates, etc.
3) Cleaning the data: The next step was to clean the data by fixing all identified problems that were identified in the exploration step. This involved removing duplicate rows, ensuring each column has the correct data type, extracting further information from already existing data, dropping columns which would not be of use in further analysis, performing further arithemetic operations, etc.

### Project Goals:

The aim of this project was to:

1) To ensure the dataset is properly prepared and suitable for analysis

### Project Tools:

The following tools were used for this project:

1) Microsoft Excel
2) Microsoft Excel Power Query
